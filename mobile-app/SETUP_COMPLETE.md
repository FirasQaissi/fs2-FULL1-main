## ⚠️ Before You Build - REQUIRED STEPS

### 1. Update Website URL (CRITICAL!)

Edit `www/index.html` line 45:

```javascript
// Change this:
const WEBSITE_URL = "YOUR_WEBSITE_URL_HERE";

// To your actual URL:
const WEBSITE_URL = "https://your-actual-website.com";
```

### 2. Update App Identity

Edit `capacitor.config.json`:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.yourcompany.appname",  // Change this
  "appName": "Your App Name",          // Change this
  ...
}
```

### 3. Sync Changes

```bash
cd mobile-app
npm run sync
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to mobile-app folder
cd mobile-app

# Sync changes to native projects
npm run sync

## 🔧 System Requirements

### Android Development

   - [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

2. **Install and set JAVA_HOME:**

   ```powershell
   # Windows PowerShell
   setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11"
   ```

3. **Restart terminal and verify:**
   ```bash
   java -version
   # Should show version 11 or higher
   ```

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed instructions.
