## üéØ What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Update Your Website URL ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

Open `www/index.html` and find line 45:

**Change this:**

```javascript
const WEBSITE_URL = "YOUR_WEBSITE_URL_HERE";
```

**To your actual deployed website:**

```javascript
const WEBSITE_URL = "https://your-actual-deployed-website.com";
```

### Step 2: Install Java JDK 11+ (Required for Building)

Your system has Java 8, but Android requires Java 11+.

1. **Download JDK 11+:** https://adoptium.net/
2. **Install it**
3. **Set JAVA_HOME:**
   ```powershell
   setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11"
   setx PATH "%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin"
   ```
4. **Restart your terminal**

### Step 3: Install Android Studio (if not installed)

Download: https://developer.android.com/studio

### Step 4: Build Your App

After updating the website URL and installing Java 11+:

```bash
cd mobile-app
npm run sync
npm run open:android
```

Then in Android Studio:

- Wait for Gradle sync
- Go to `Build` ‚Üí `Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)` ‚Üí `Build APK(s)`
- APK will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## üì± Testing Your App

**For Debug/Testing (No Keystore Needed):**

1. Build debug APK in Android Studio
2. Transfer APK to your phone
3. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"
4. Install and test!

**For Production Release (Keystore Needed):**

- Only create keystore when ready to publish to Play Store
- See [KEYTOOL_FIX.md](KEYTOOL_FIX.md) for instructions
